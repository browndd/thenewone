      <b> <h7> Who I am </h7> </b>
        <p>First off, thank you for visiting my personal website! My name is DeAnte Brown. I am enrolled in the Integrated Information Technology (iIT) program at the University of South Carolina. That's right iIT! This program is a little different than an ordinary IT program. Here at the University of South Carolina IT skills are not just simply taught to you through ordinary means such as: books, power points or exams. The iIT program takes it a step further and actually presents its' students with live projects such as: building a computer from scratch, publishing your own website, being apart of a project team and running your own project. This E-portfolio is just a small example of the projects that we do throughout the iIT program here at the University of South Carolina.</p>
      <b>  <h7> Interest, Goals & Aspirations </h7> </b>
        <p>In May of 2016 I will have completed my undergraduate studies at the University of South Carolina and have to choice to either continue my education with Graduate School, or join the working force. Being the knowledge seeker that I am I plan to do both! I plan to use my IT background and break into the business world. In the business world I will work for a few years until I am able to comfortably afford whatever Graduate school I choose. As of right now I plan to go to graduate school to obtain my MBA. Once I do complete that I will be ready to truly take on whatever comes my way. Although I do have a strong interest in the business world, I also have an interest in other fields of IT. Such as: hardware/software development, web development, cyber security and project management.     </p>

        <b> <h7>VC3</h7> </b>
        <p>The Summer of 2015, I had my first real IT job with company called VC3. VC3 is an IT company that has been on the leading edge of of Information Technology since 1994, providing customer-oriented solutions to both commercial and public sector customer. VC3's most dinstinguished product is with cloud computing. Thanks to cloud computing VC3's long term strategic goals have been made into reality.
At VC3, I am a Systems Engineer Intern and I must say...I love it! I am being exsposed to so many different fields within IT such as: working with servers, hardware, software, computer viruses and even dealing with customers (face-to-face and remotely). The amount of experience and knowledge gained from this internship is truly immeasurable. Thanks to the people at this company and how this company is ran, I now have a better idea of what I want from the future. I now know my strengths and weakness a lot better than I did before.
This experience truly opened my eyes to how the working world really works. Before I thought make the grades and I'll be OK, but now I no longer have such a premature thoughts. Sure grades do help you get the Internship, which in term will eventually lead to a decent job. However, classes only teach you the basics of that subject. For example, I took a web design class my Sophmore year in college and from that class I did learn a few things about web design and could make a simple website. Now at VC3 there are a lot of great minds, great minds that I picked at and learned from as much as possible. The result of that is this E-Portfolio that I have created. </p>
      <b> <h7>Men's Soccer Manager</h7> </b>

Responsibilities are: managing equipment, filming, assisting with practices, attending to the needs of head coach Mark Berson as well as the assistant coaches, ensuring all travel gear and material are ready for travel, and assist athletic trainers with their duties. </p>
